## Problem 3: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

This is a coding challenge given from the itemis AG. I really appreciate the chance to show-off my learned skills. :notebook:
For this task I am going to use vanilla Javascript and print the results to the console.

## PSEUDOCODE :bulb:

- declare the roman numerals to variables
- declare galaxy currency to variables
- a function who asks for a string and converts to an array
- the array elements are split with ""
- reduce array to readable values e.g. prok, pish, Silver etc.
- run another function which sorts the array to the romanic principle and returns the result
