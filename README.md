## Problem 3: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

This is a coding challenge given from the itemis AG. I really appreciate the chance to show-off my learned skills. :notebook:
For this task I am going to use vanilla Javascript and print the results to the console.

## PSEUDOCODE :bulb:

- declare galaxy currency to roman numerals to variables
- a function who asks for a string and converts to an array
- the array elements are split with " "
- save the array into a new variable if it includes Silver, Gold or Iron
- reduce array to readable values e.g. prok, pish etc.
- assign those string values the galaxy currency values
- run another function which sorts the array to the romanic principle and returns the result
- read from the saved array what is included (Silver, Gold or Iron) and multiply it with the romanic principle result
- add error message "I have no idea what you are talking about" if none of the above is applied
