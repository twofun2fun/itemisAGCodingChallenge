## Problem 3: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

This is a coding challenge given from the itemis AG. I really appreciate the chance to show-off my learned skills. :notebook:
For this task I am going to use vanilla Javascript and print the results to the console.

## PSEUDOCODE :bulb:

- declare galaxy currency to roman numerals to variables
- declare Gold, Silver & Iron to variables
- a function who asks for a string and converts to an array
- the array elements are split with " "
- run an if statement to check if there is Gold, Silver or Iron in the string
- if there is Gold, Silver or Iron multiply the result with the corresponding value
- reduce array to readable values e.g. prok, pish etc.
- assign those string values the galaxy currency values
- run another function which sorts the array to the romanic principle and returns the result
- add error message "I have no idea what you are talking about" if none of the above is applied

## My notes :memo:

First of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity. The coding challenge was a lot of fun.

My first approach was to pseudocode the problem. This helps me to get an overview of the problem and break it down into
smaller problems. Once I got the grasp of the problem I move on to translate it into a program.

While doing that I faced some problems translating the pseudocode. At this stage I decided to take a step back
and switch my focus from programming to understand the problem more. As soon as I managed to divide the problem into even more smaller pieces
I went back to programming.

In the programming stage I focused to get the first test output working. Immediately after that I tackled the next problems.
When I was done with the rough programming I analyzed my code an went to refactor it using the DRY principle. This makes a possible to change my code without
changing it for each condition.

Thanks for your attention!
